            <h1>I started with hatred </h1>
            <P>I thought there is nothing like love and even If there is </P>
            <p>I thought I can run away from it</p>
            <p>I thought It was fake there is nothing like love</p>
            <p>I was filled with hatred for women</p>
            <p>Every woman was my mortal enemy</p>
            <p>Though I never did anything extreme to harm a woman my heart wasn't allowing me</p>
            <p>Woman was like a plague I had to run away from</p>
            <p>They were all cruel that was in my head</p>
            <p>But you came into my life</p>
            <p>The first time you were my enemy</p>
            <p>You taught me how to smile </p>
            <p>At least It wasn't a fake smile</p>
            <P>You</P>
